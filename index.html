          <p>
            This tool generates a layout that is responsive, which means it
            looks great on phones! Use dropdowns above to customize your
            layout's general features. Click the button to generate your HTML
            and CSS, and paste it into a file on Neocities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you can replace all of the text with your own. For more
            customization, the CSS code has comments to explain what each part
            changes. Please read through the code - even if you have no idea
            what it means.
